Without early stopping, the running time is deterministically equal to $k$. The early stopping procedure significantly increases the efficiency, particularly when $p$ is small or $k$ is large. The minimum number of queries is one for all $k$ and $p$, and of course the $k=1$ (identity) Bernoulli factory requires exactly one query for any $p$.}}{3}}
